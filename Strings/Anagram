"""

      Given two strings a and b consisting of lowercase characters. 
      The task is to check whether two given strings are an anagram of each other or not. An anagram of a string is 
      another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different. 
      
      For example, act and tac are an anagram of each other.

      Example 1:

          Input:a = geeksforgeeks, b = forgeeksgeeks

          Output: YES
          
          Explanation: Both the string have same characters with
          same frequency. So, both are anagrams.


      Example 2:

          Input:a = allergy, b = allergic

          Output: NO
          
          Explanation: Characters in both the strings are 
          not same, so they are not anagrams.


      Your Task:
      
      You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isAnagram() 
      which takes the string a and string b as input parameter and check if the two strings are an anagram of each other. 
      The function returns true if the strings are anagram else it returns false.
